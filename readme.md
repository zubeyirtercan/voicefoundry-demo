# VoiceFoundry Demo Project

## Introduction
This project is a demo project for Voicefoundry. It uses Amazon Connect service as its base and utilizes some other AWS services.

Project implements a contact flow that could be attached to a phone number in Amazon Connect. When a client calls the flow triggers a lamda function to calculate the possible vanity numbers according the caller's phone number. The Lambda function saves the best 5 of those numbers to the DynamoDB and returns top 3 of them to the flow and flow reads them aloud to the caller. The vanity number are checked against a list of abbreviations scraped from Wikipedia and sorted by length from longest to the shortest.

There is aslo a Lambda function that has a public URL to display last 5 records in the DynamoDB. 

## Services
This demo project uses the following AWS services
- Amazon Connect
- DynamoDB
- S3
- Lambda
- IAM

## Setup
The CloudFormation template has been designed in a way that you do not need to compile anything on your local machine unless you explicitly want to do so. Therefore two setup options has been included.

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- An Amazon Connect instance
- Preferably a phone number attached to the Connect Instance to test the flow (optional)

If you meet the prerequisites above you can launch the stack. Please use the region on which your Amazon Connect instance resides. All the resources will be created automatically.

### Updating the ContactFlow
Because of the limitations of the Amazon Connect service, the ContactFlow needs to be updated manually. At least, for now.

- Login into your Amazon Connect instance. Please use Chrome or Firefox
- Go to the page Routing > Contact flows 
- In the contact flow list find "VoiceFoundry Demo Flow" and open it
- From the combo-button on the top-right corner select "Import flow (beta)"
- Either use [the file flow in this project](ContactFlow%5CVoiceFoundryDemo.json) or download from [here](https://voicefoundry-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/VoiceFoundryDemo.json) and import it into the contact flow.
- Now we need to update the Lambda function ARN in the flow. In order to do this go to the Outputs tab of the CloudFormation stack
- Select and copy the LambdaARN value
- Back to the flow and find the "Invoke AWS Lambda Function" block and click to open the details.
- Paste the function ARN in the clipboard into the "Function ARN" selector directly.
- Publish the flow by clicking "Publish"

## Testing

- If you have a toll free or DID number to test you can attach the flow to that number and make a call.
- Vanity numbers will be generated and top 5 of them will be saved to the DynamoDB, top 3 of them will be read to the caller during the flow
- You can list the last 5 records in the DynamoDB table by clicking the WebpageURL in the CloudFormation outputs tab.
- The working version of this project can be called at `+1 800-497-0290` and the last 5 records can be liste [here](https://wilbgizatuaix6pfqjl5c6pnku0ovxtz.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws/)

## Lambda Functions Manual Update

It is possible to compile and deploy the Lambda functions from the source code. There are two Lambda function:

- `generate-vanity-numbers-ts`: This function generates possible vanity numbers, stores top 5 to the DynamoDB and returns top 3 to the caller flow
- `webpage-ts`: This function lists the last 5 calls and generated vanity number by the flow

Both of those functions are written in TypeScript and can be compiled and deployed by using `npm run deploy` function declared in the respective `package.json` files. 

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI
- AWS credentials set-up locally
- Node.js
- npm
- 7-Zip (or any other equivalent)

### Deploying Lambda Functions

- Fully download this project to your locale
- Go to the root folder (folder above src folder) of either function.
- Open `package.json` file and find the occurences of `voicefoundry-artifacts-8106ee20` and replace it with the `ArtifactsBucket` value from the Outputs tab in the CloudFormation result page. Please note that the bucket name occurs twice in the package file.
- If you have 7-Zip installed it will be used automatically. But if you prefer to use any other compression utility please update the `zip` command in the `package.json` file.
- Open the terminal window and type `npm run deploy`
- This command will install all the packages, build the project, zip it, upload the S3 bucket generated by the CloudFormation template and update the Lambda function automatically.
